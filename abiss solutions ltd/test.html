                <h2>About Us - Why Choose ABISS Solutions?</h2>
                <p class="abouttext">ABISS is a privately owned company with a portfolio of multi-disciplined services and a proven track record of providing combined solutions to projects from audit, project management, shopfitting, installation and joinery in the domestic and commercial markets. ABISS was originally formed in June 2014 as a direct result of growth in the showroom sectors and after working solely with a blue chip retailer, re-established themselves in June 2017 to the domestic and commercial markets. Through our vast experience and knowledge, we have established a firm platform on which to offer support to our clients. We are dedicated to providing turnkey solutions on all our projects, no matter how big or small, through our own professional and experienced teams, backed up where necessary by our support partners.</p>

ABISS has the ability to react to most requirements through our own comprehensive database of installers and tradepersons. All of our installers have vetted through a national insitute of the industry with many having time served experience of working with ABISS through dozens of program projects within a large DIY organization. Having recently introduced new service components to our repertoire of solutions, including supply and joinery, this further enhances our ability to provide turnkey solutions to the most complicated projects. ABISS recognises that our clients have many options when it comes to service suppliers, however we are not trying to be the same as the rest of the market but stand alone with our unique service offer as we can tailor our support to individual client needs. We see things a bit differently from the main stream and offer packages of services that fully support the client requirements</p>

                <p>Our goal is to deliver our client objectives quicker, better and simpler in the most cost-effective way on a right first time basis.</p>
